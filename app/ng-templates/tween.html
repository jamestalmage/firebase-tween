<h1>Debounce with Filter And Tween</h1>
<p>
  Instead of burning through our bandwidth trying to get fast enough updates to make the
  <em highlight="receiving">receiving</em> side look smooth, we take slower updates and fake a smooth animation
  with tweening.
</p>
<p>
  This example has an even longer debounce than any previous example(400ms),
  saving more bandwidth than any other method. Even so, it appears smoother than previous methods.
  Note that it does introduce a noticeable delay when you view two instances side by side, but that is probably
  not your intended use case. If a separate person was viewing your actions remotely, they likely would not notice
  the delay. However, such a long debounce would be poor for latency critical games (first person shooter, etc).
</p>
<p>
  The tweening could probably be improved in a few ways (maybe a better easing function or predictive overshooting).
  But it is already significantly better than any other solution.
</p>
<p>
  Also, if you can detect the presence of someone watching your edits,
  you could dynamically decrease the debounce interval down to something like
  <a ng-click="setPath('/faster')" href="">150ms.</a>
