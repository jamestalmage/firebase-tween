<h1>Debounce with Filter</h1>
<p>We can get rid of the visual glitches on the <em highlight="sending">sending side</em> pretty easy. When firebase
  triggers an $$updated event on the array - we check to make sure we don't have a pending save.
  We are going to overwrite anyways, so lets just discard the data.
</p>
<p>
  Now the <em highlight="sending">sending</em> side is super smooth! Only thing left is to try and smooth out the
  <em highlight="receiving">receiving</em> side.
