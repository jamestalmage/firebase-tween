<h1>Debounce</h1>
<p>
  To save bandwidth and smooth performance, we introduce a debounce function that limits the rate at which
  $save() is called on the angularFire collection.
</p>
<p>
  This works to reduce data costs, and frees up CPU cycles on both the <em highlight="sending">sending</em> and
  <em highlight="receiving">receiving</em> sides.
</p>
<p>
  In this example, $save() is called at most once every 200ms (a 4x reduction in transfers).
  The receiving end sees movement that is as smooth or smoother than it was when we weren't doing any rate limiting
</p>
<p>
  The biggest problem here is that the <em highlight="sending">sending</em> side  experiences
  a number of visual glitches. This is due to the delayed $save() call - it causes scope to get updated briefly with
  stale data.
