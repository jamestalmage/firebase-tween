<h1>Faster</h1>

  Same as Debounce, Filter &amp; Tween, but with a faster 125ms debounce.

  With such a short debounce, I have still seen it saturate the connection and cause glitches on the
  <em highlight="receiving">receiving side</em>, but for the most part it's really smooth.
  A more advanced implementation might dynamically adjust the debounce rate based on a slow connections,
  and whether or not changes were being observed by someone else.
